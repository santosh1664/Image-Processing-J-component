# On Using Transfer Learning For Plant Leaf Disease Detection

Code for the paper `On Using Transfer Learning For Plant Leaf Disease Detection`.
## Data

The dataset can be downloaded from [here]
## Environment and tools

1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Scikit-image
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikit-learn
7. Keras

## Installation

`pip install numpy pandas scikit-image matplotlib scikit-learn keras`

`jupyter notebook`
For part1 code:
Step 1: Open pycharm, google colab, jupiter notebook. 
Step 2: Using the code replace the name of the image you want to check for the which has disease in it or not. 
Step 3: Save the image in the directory and then replace the name in the code. 
Step 4: Then run the code. 
Step 5: We can observe several outputs which shows us the transition the image is going through or processes involved.
Step 6: The final image particular shows then it has disease in it or else no disease/healthy.
For part2 code:
Step 1: Open google colab. 
Step 2: Upload the images in google drive. 
Step 3: Import the yes images of dataset. 
Step 4: Import the no images of the dataset from drive to colab. 
Step 5: Let the partitions of code run you can see the transition outputs in the middle. 
Step 6: The last part in prediction change the input image and check for the result. 
Step 7: U will get leaf is helthy or not.
